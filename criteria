A player is eligible for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame if satisfies the following criteria:

1. The player must have competed in ten seasons. A single game counts as a "season" in the eyes of the Hall.
2. The player has been retired for at least five seasons. 
   If a player comes back and plays in the major leagues, the clock restarts. 
   The easiest way to figure out the rule is to add six to the last season the player was active. Therefore, players eligible in 2007 played their last game in 2001.
2. A screening committee must approve the player's worthiness. Most players are given a token appearance on the ballot if they meet the ten year rule and they were a regular player for most of that time.
3. The player may not be on the ineligible list (banned from baseball).
4. If a player dies within the five year span, he is eligible six months after his death provided he meets the above criteria. If an active player dies, he is eligible six months after his death.
5. To remain on the ballot, the player must receive at least five percent of the votes for any given year. If a player fails to receive 5%. He falls off the ballot until 16 years after his retirement (see below).
6. A player is considered elected if he receives at least 75% of all ballots cast in an election.

Committee on Baseball Veterans

All players who competed in 10 seasons at least 21 years before the election and all Negro League players with ten years of total service are eligible for election.
Members are urged to consider the entire career of the player. For example, Joe Torre was considered for his 18 years as a player and his career as a manager.
When a candidate turns 65, he is eligible six months after retirement. This applies to managers, umpires and executives.
Anyone receiving at least 75% of the vote is considered elected.
